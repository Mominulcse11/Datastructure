              What is Data Structure (DS)?

• Data structure is a collection of data and the associated
operations.
• It is the way of organizing and storing data in a computer system
so that it can be used efficiently.
• This organization can be in the form of a group of data elements
stored under one name.
• Here, the data elements are referred as members of the data
structure.
• Members can be of different types and lengths.


                Commonly used data structures are
▪ Arrays, Linked lists
▪ Stacks, Queues
▪ Graphs, Trees
▪ Heaps
▪ Hash Tables
▪ Disjoint Sets etc.
• Algorithms are used to manipulate the data structures in a
number of different ways, like sorting the data elements or
searching a particular data item.

                Characteristics of DS

• It depicts the logical representation of data in computer memory.
• It represents the logical relationship between the various data
elements.
• It helps in efficient manipulations of stored data elements.
• It allows the programs to process data in an efficient manner.

                 Types Of DS

• Primitive DS : include all the fundamental data structures that can be directly manipulated by machine-level instructions.

• Non-primitive DS : on the other hand, refer to all those data structures that are derived from one or more primitive data structures.

The objective of creating non-primitive data structures is to form
sets of homogeneous or heterogeneous data elements.

• In linear data structures, all the data elements are arranged in a
linear or sequential fashion.
• In non-linear data structures, there is no definite order or
sequence in which data elements are arranged.
• For instance, a non-linear data structure could arrange data
elements in a hierarchical fashion.

                  DS Operations

• Traversing: It is the process of accessing each record of a data
structure exactly once.
• Searching: It is the process of identifying the location of a record
that contains a specific key value.
• Inserting: It is the process of adding a new record in to a data
structure.
• Deleting: It is the process of removing an existing record from a
data structure.

 Apart from these typical data structure operations, there are some
other operations associated with data structures, such as:

• Sorting: It is the process of arranging the records of a data
structure in a specific order, such as, alphabetical, ascending, or
descending.
• Merging: It is the process of combining the records of two
different sorted data structures to produce a single sorted data
set.
